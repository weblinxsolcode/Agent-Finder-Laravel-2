                <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>Welcome to our website <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.agentchoice.com.au/">(www.agentchoice.com.au)</a> If you continue to browse and use
                    this website you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following disclaimer, together with our
                    terms and conditions of use.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">The Agent Choice Holdings Pty Limited ABN 68 271 308 458 trading as Agent Choice is an
                    independent entity, and while we provide a platform to compare real estate agents, we are not affiliated
                    with, endorsed by, or in partnership with any of the real estate agents or agencies listed on our
                    website. The information provided on our website is for general informational purposes only and does not
                    constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or advice regarding any particular agent or agency.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">The selection of agents on The Agent Choice website is based on specific performance
                    criteria, ensuring that only the top three performing agents are listed. This selection process is
                    conducted independently, without influence or input from any real estate agents or agencies.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">We do not charge consumers for using our comparison service. Instead, we receive a service
                    fee from the agents when a customer connects with them through our service and successfully lists,
                    sells, or rents their property. This fee is charged on a pay-on-success basis, meaning agents only pay
                    if they successfully list and either sell or rent the property.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">The Agent Choice makes no guarantees or representations regarding the likelihood of a
                    sale, the performance outcomes, or the effectiveness of any real estate agents or agencies listed on our
                    website. The performance, effectiveness, and suitability of any agent remain solely the responsibility
                    of the individual agents and agencies. Any decisions made by clients regarding which agent to engage are
                    made at their own discretion and risk. </p>
                <p class="mt-2">The information contained in this website is for general information purposes only and is
                    provided by Agent Choice. While we endeavour to keep the information up to date and correct, we make no
                    representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy,
                    reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the website or the information, products,
                    services, or related graphics contained on the website for any purpose. Any reliance you place on such
                    information is therefore strictly at your own risk. You need to make your own enquiries to determine if
                    the information or products are appropriate for your intended use.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">In no event will we be liable for any loss or damage including without limitation,
                    indirect or consequential loss or damage, or any loss or damage whatsoever arising from loss of data or
                    profits arising out of, or in connection with, the use of this website.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Through this website you may be able to link to other websites which are not under the
                    control of Agent Choice. We have no control over the nature, content and availability of those websites.
                    The inclusion of any links does not necessarily imply a recommendation or endorse the views expressed
                    within them.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Every effort is made to keep the website up and running smoothly. However, Agent Choice
                    takes no responsibility for, and will not be liable for, the website being temporarily unavailable due
                    to technical issues beyond our control.</p>
